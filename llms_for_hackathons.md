# Informational Document: LLM Use in Hackathons

This living document, hosted on GitHub, aims to catalog considerations for the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hackathons. It includes recommendations for both participants and organizers. Once complete, it may inform a future paper on the topic (TBD).

## Prompt: How can LLMs be leveraged to increase the output from hackathons?

Large Language Models (LLMs) can greatly enhance hackathons for both participants and organizers, serving as tools for creativity, efficiency, and collaboration. Here's how they can be effectively incorporated:

By leveraging LLMs, hackathons can become more inclusive, productive, and engaging for everyone involved!

## Uses for Participants

### Ideation
- **Reference**: Co-intelligence by Ethan Mollick.
  - Come up with new ideas.
  - Iterate on ideas.

### Content Creation
- Writing code.
- Navigating architecture and process.
- Navigating GitHub (e.g., see summer school presentation on HTH4 Day 2).

### LLMs for Non-LLM Purposes vs LLM-Creation Hackathons

---

## Uses for Organizers

### Pre-Hackathon
- Creating materials (rubrics, guidelines, onboarding content).
- Participant survey summary:
  - Cluster participants based on similar or non-similar interests and abilities.

### During Hackathon
- Promote cross-disciplinary ideation.
- Event documentation.
- Feedback form summary.
- Using LLMs to measure outputs (objective measures only, not to judge quality).

### Post-Hackathon
- Document learnings from hackathons using LLMs (e.g., transcripts and outputs fed into LLMs for ELI5 summaries, reviewed by authors).

## Networking Facilitation

- Suggest connections between participants or teams with complementary skills.

## Ethical Considerations

*this section needs to be cleaned up and changed to markdown*

Ethical considerations
If competition is involved, does using an LLM constitute 'cheating'?
it is important for organizers to be clear on rules and expectations
* How can participation rules address the use of LLMs? (to even the playing fields for all participants?) 
Add - Intellectual property
What are additional considerations and concerns regarding authorship of code/output that come from LLMs 
sharing data with LLMs that is sensitive or you don't own - this becomes part of the training data (!!!!)

Based on the papers below here are 5 ethical considerations:
1. Bias in Outputs LLMs may produce outputs that reflect inherent biases in their training data, which can unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes or inequalities in hackathon solutions​ [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2406.11400) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2306.06283)
2. Transparency in Usage Hackathon teams should clearly communicate how LLMs are used, ensuring participants and stakeholders understand AI's role in generating ideas or solutions​ [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2405.14445) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2306.06283)
2a Is there an element of "shaming" with admitting to LLM use? Is there a way to survey anonymously to avoid the double bind
2b Organizers should provide guidance on LLM use including ethical considerations. This serves as an opportunity for education around ethical use of LLMs.
2c The user is still responsible for outputs, 

3. Over-reliance on AI Excessive dependence on LLMs can lead to reduced critical thinking or failure to scrutinize AI-generated outputs, especially when data accuracy is crucial [ar5iv] (https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2405.14445) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2306.06283v3)
4. Safety and Misinformation LLMs can produce incorrect or misleading information if not properly guided, posing risks in sensitive fields like healthcare, education, or scientific research [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2406.11400) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2306.06283v3)
5. Ethical Accessibility LLM-based tools should be designed to ensure inclusivity and fairness, avoiding barriers for less technically proficient participants or marginalized groups​ [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2406.11400) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2306.06283v3)
	5a groups with paid subscriptions might have access to better models and have an advantage
.

What should people NOT do with LLMs?
Upload proprietary and/or sensitive data or information
Upload copyrighted materials
Use LLMs alone to make decisions especially about resources or people
Use LLMs to judge quality 

Prototyping
Outputs
use an LLM to create a digital output
 - eg website wireframe, drawing to html, 
use an LLM to create a prototype
get step by step
get ideas for your prototype


### Key Questions
- If competition is involved, does using an LLM constitute "cheating"?
- How can participation rules address the use of LLMs to even the playing field?
- What are the intellectual property implications of LLM-generated content?

### Limitations
- LLMs are not always reliable for judging outputs.
- Feedback should align with organizer goals (e.g., positive reinforcement).
- Sensitive or proprietary data should not be shared with LLMs.

## Ethical Considerations for Organizers and Participants

### Participants
- **Idea Generation**:
  - Avoid plagiarism and ensure attribution.
- **Coding Assistance**:
  - Verify generated code for originality and bias.
- **Content Creation**:
  - Ensure factual accuracy and originality.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Communicate transparently about LLM usage.

### Organizers
- **Event Management**:
  - Ensure fairness and transparency in automation.
- **Participant Support**:
  - Train LLMs to provide respectful and accurate support.
- **Judging**:
  - Use LLM evaluations as supplementary tools, not replacements.

## Limitations of LLMs

1. Bias in Outputs.
2. Transparency in Usage:
   - Guidance on ethical considerations.
   - Anonymous surveys to prevent double bind situations.
3. Over-Reliance:
   - Critical thinking should remain central.
4. Safety and Misinformation.
5. Ethical Accessibility:
   - Avoid barriers for less technically proficient participants.

---

## Prototyping with LLMs

- Create digital outputs (e.g., website wireframes).
- Build prototypes with step-by-step guidance from LLMs.
